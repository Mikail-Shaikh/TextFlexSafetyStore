Safety first: You are in the driver’s seat when delivering with Amazon Flex, and your safety is our priority. If you arrive at a delivery location and do not feel safe, you can contact Support through the Amazon Flex app. We don’t expect you to ever make a delivery if you feel unsafe.
Customer and community accountability: If you have a safety concern, you can report it to Support through the Amazon Flex app. Reporting incidents to Support helps us research and follow up on them, to help keep you safe, and hold customers and community members accountable.
